# NLP-from-Noob-to-Pro
This one is like a one stop for all the things you need to know in Natural Language Processing.


**Contents:**
1. Classical Machine Learning approach for NLP
  - Text Preprocessing (Level 1)- Tokenization,Lemmatization,StopWords,POS
  - Text Preprocessing (Level 2)- Bag Of  Words, TFIDF, Unigrams,Bigrams,n-grams

2. Deep Learning for NLP
  - Using Word Embeddings:
    - Understanding Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTM,GRU.
