# NLP-from-Noob-to-Pro
This one is like a one stop for all the things you need to know in Natural Language Processing.


**Contents:**
*1.Text Preprocessing (Level 1)- Tokenization,Lemmatization,StopWords,POS:*
This one would contain all the basic techniques to preprocess the textual data.
2.Text Preprocessing (Level 2)- Bag Of  Words, TFIDF, Unigrams,Bigrams,n-grams
This one has all the stuff after text preprocessing that would convert this textual data to numeric data so that we can use it in models.
3.Text Preprocessing- Gensim,Word2vec,AvgWord2vec
5.Solve Machine Learning Usecases
6.Get the Understanding Of Artificial Neural Network
7.Understanding Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTM,GRU
8.Text Preprocessing Level 3- Word Embeddings, Word2vec
9.Bidirectional LSTM RNN, Encoders And Decoders, Attention Models
